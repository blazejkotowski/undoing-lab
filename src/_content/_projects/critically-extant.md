process:

For Entangled Others’ installation ‘Critically Extant’ we researched on concepts of species extinction and data representation, identifying and testing approaches and techniques for synthetic soundscapes, and processing the provided audio material towards post-natural aesthetics.

We eventually created a soundscape for the initial sounds to nestle in a way that was complementing the visual artwork. For the set-up we used spatial elements to attune to the exhibition space, simulating the listening experience of being in nature. The result was a hyperrealistic, lively environment imbued with ecological sensitivity.
