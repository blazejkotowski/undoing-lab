For the sound we crafted for "Vivarium," we delved into the research topic of embodied AI. Game, sci-fi, and documentary aesthetics influenced our approach to sound design. The process involved prototyping and multiple iterations, exploring new montage configurations to ensure an innovative and immersive sonic experience for the audience.

Throughout the process, we meticulously crafted emotive atmospheres, foley, and sound effects to organise the fast pace of the animation and facilitate comprehension of the dense voiceover. The result, a futuristic sonic universe that seamlessly integrated into the speculative essence of the project, conveys the ability to transform highly sophisticated concepts into consumable and engaging audiovisual experience.
