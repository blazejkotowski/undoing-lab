**Błażej Kotowski** is an artist and researcher born and raised in Poland, currently based in Barcelona. Situated at the intersection of art, sound, technology, software, and politics, his work delves into the transformative impact of new technologies on the human psyche, with a particular focus on the notion of the (cyber) sublime—an aesthetic of digital awe and wonder.

Driven by a passion for comprehending the evolving relationship between humanity and technology, Błażej crafts speculative narratives that manifest as sound works, generative systems, installations, and performances. In his research, he is currently pursuing a PhD at the Music Technology Group, where he examines the intricacies of AI's architectural design.
